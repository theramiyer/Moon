Meraki Post started off as _A Cup of Coffee and a Fairytale_, a book blog on which one of my friends used to post reviews of the books she read. A few years later, the site saw a serious transformation and became a community of book-lovers with enterprise-class IT infrastructure as its back-end, and a dynamic team of four as its front-end.
