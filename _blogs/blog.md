In spite of the cliched "My take on the world" stand that most blogs boast as their tag line, blogging still remains a more civilised manner of expression of views, besides being a great way to unwind. Ram's blog is part satire, part rants and part what defines the oft-misunderstood "Bangalore IT Pro" life.
