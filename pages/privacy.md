This is serious. Pay attention.

## What do I do with your information

When you buy something from me, as part of the buying and selling process, I may collect the personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address.

With your permission, I may send you emails about my products and services, and other updates.

## Consent

How do you get my consent?

When you give me personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, or place an order, I imply that you consent to my collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.

If I ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, I will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or let you say no.

How do you withdraw your consent?

If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for me to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by contacting me at &#104;&#105;&#64;&#114;&#97;&#109;&#105;&#121;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#109;&#101;.

However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information I am required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.

For these providers, I recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.

In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a different jurisdiction than either you or me. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
