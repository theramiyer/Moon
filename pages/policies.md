This page will be in plain English.

While I do my best to deliver the best possible, there could be instances where my services did not meet your expectations. In general, I work in close co-ordination with my clients, which means that we establish a live feedback loop. We understand each other and correct our courses constantly.

I log my work in hours, and charge for every hour of work, rounded to the nearest one up. This means, if I have worked for three hours and twenty-two minutes, I charge for four hours.

## Cancellation

You can cancel the work at any point, and I will charge you for the hours I spent working on the project. (For definitions, go to the [Terms and Conditions](/terms/).) If the total number of hours spent on the project is worth less than the advance paid by you, I will refund the difference. If the number of hours spent on the project is worth more than the advance paid by you, you will need to pay the difference.

## Refund

When working in close co-ordination, the concept of refunds does not appear, unless in the context as mentioned above. But there could be unusual conditions in any transaction, in which case, I will issue a refund of up to 50% on a case-to-case basis, which we will mutually agree upon before the commencement of the project.

## Late or missing refunds (if applicable)

If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Or contact your credit card company. It may take some time before your refund is officially posted, and this depends on the payment gateway you used.

If you’ve done all this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact me at &#104;&#105;&#64;&#114;&#97;&#109;&#105;&#121;&#101;&#114;&#46;&#109;&#101;.
