This page will be in plain English that you and I are familiar with.

This is tough talk, but unavoidable because I have had my share of experiences.

## Definitions

I refer to myself (Ramakrishnan Iyer) as I, along with the use of relevant pronouns. Similarly, I will refer to the client as 'You'.

By purchasing something from me, you engage in my "Service" and agree to the following terms and conditions. These terms have no exceptions, and apply to you if you avail any of my services in any form. If you do not agree to these terms, you must mention it explicitly in our conversation, before the commencement of the "project" to deliver the service, after which, we have no business. Also, these terms and conditions may change at any time without prior notice; read this page before you approach me for any product or service.

## Stay legal

You will not use any of my products or services for any illegal or unauthorised purpose.

## Charges

I charge per hour of work. I will record the number of hours spent on the work and send you the report, which you will need to pay for. I can give you the details of what took how long, but not at the micro level---nobody likes micro-management, and I will charge for every hour spent in reporting the work, if it requires anything more than generating a time report from the system that I use to track time. Better not to go down that line.

## Completeness and timelines

Before I begin working on a project, we will have a meeting, during which, we finalise what you need, what you consider complete, and by when you need it. We will come to a consensus on these items _before_ I begin working.

I believe in working in close co-ordination with clients, and we agree to respond to each other's queries within four hours. The time spent waiting does not count as time spent working, unless I can work on items not dependent on the query. I will record this time and report the same.

While I believe in having some leeway and minor deviations caused due to changes in the business or understanding, understand that if the work warrants added work, it will affect the total time spent on the work, which I will bill for.

Consulting counts as work. I will charge for the time spent over the phone with you to discuss the project, even if you were merely gathering ideas, because my ideas come from efforts spent in learning the system. I am sincere towards what I do---which means that professional conversations with me will be of substance---and I value my work.

I reserve the right to limit the service to any person or geographic region. I may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. I also reserve the right to stop working on a project at any time, as much as you may withdraw the contract; in either case, I will charge you for the time spent working on your project, which you must pay.

I do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that I will correct any errors in the product or service.

## Third party products and services

Nobody re-invents the wheel. We buy components, reuse code, and rely on external services for our activities. We will agree on the payment for any purchases made to deliver the product or service to you, before I begin working on the project. I will run by you any purchases you will need to pay for.

In cases where I use third party products and services, I take no liability whatsoever arising from or relating to your use of these third party products and/or services cause you. I also make available the third party products and services "as is" and "as available" without any warranties, representations or conditions of any kind with or without any endorsement. In other words, when using third party products and services, all qualms are between you and the third party; whatever you use is at your own risk and discretion.

## Personal information

I will handle all the personal information you give me, as per my privacy policy.
